HI
--
My name is Yotam and I'm an aspiring developer. My experise is javascript and frontend development, I have a deep background in dot.net technologies 
but none of that matters because these are all means for creation.

I only work on projects that interst me, these are solutions for things I encounter in my every-day's life which I try to make better.

I'm currently working on formalizing karaoke clips by defining a standard structure for it.
In that process I'm learning about standards and managing multi-project platfroms

You can find me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yotam-madar-4a618214/)
